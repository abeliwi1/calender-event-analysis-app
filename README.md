# Cancel My Calendar

Cancel My Calendar analyzes your calendar and identifies meetings that are low-value or high-energy so you can confidently skip or decline them.

The app connects to your calendar, scores events based on simple rules (value vs. energy), and produces a weekly “cut list” of meetings that don’t meaningfully support your goals.
